## Syllabus

### What is the module about

This module aims to prepare graduate students pursuing a master degree in business analytics for advanced data science topics and their application in business analytics. Therefore, we design this module to help students develop a deeper understanding of machine learning models and explore their applications.The tentative topics of this course include:

- data visualization and interpretable machine learning
- bayesian learning
- bayesian hyperparameter optimization
- deep learning
- autoencoder
- variational autoencoder
- convolutional neural network
- recurrent neural network
- generative adversarial networks (GAN)
- interpretable machine learning

At the same time, we investigate several applications such as:

- sentiment analysis
- part-of-speech tagging
- name entity recognition
- machine translation
- automatic harry potter writing
- recommendation system
- image generation
- spam detection
- portfolio optimization

In summary, the key takeaways of this course are as follows:

- Understand the challenges of data collection, analysis and mining;
- Describe basic concepts and methods used in data science (E.g., data visualization, feature extraction, model ensemble, classification and clustering etc.);
- Understand conceptually the mechanism of advanced machine learning algorithms and their applications in the real-world;
- Select appropriate machine learning tools/ techniques to uncover patterns and relationships, extract useful knowledge and support decision making in business applications;
- Craft a real-world problem and assemble required tools to yield meaningful solutions and conclusion;
- Have some thoughts about scaling up from thousands of data points to billions/large scale problem.

<u>The above is the tentative content, which may be modified during the semester.</u>

### Course Policies

#### No Late Policy
Homework assignments will be posted on the website on Wednesdays and will be due the following Wednesday (listed in the course schedule). No homework assignments or project milestones will be accepted for credit after the deadline. If you have a verifiable medical condition or other special circumstances that interfere with your coursework please let us know as soon as possible by sending an email to the lecturer.

#### Collaboration Policy
We expect you to adhere to the University Honor Code at all times. Failure to adhere to the honor code and our policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course.

### Credits
Slides and notebooks in this course are based on other open classes or online resources. For example, we gain lots of ideas to prepare BT5153 from the following resources:

- [CS224D Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/): a detailed introduction to cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for NLP.
- [CPSC 540 Machine Learning](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/540-2013/lectures.html): this course focus on probabilistic machine learning, which is provided by Professor [Nandi de Freitas](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/)
- [Machine Learning](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses_ML19.html): ML related course series (in chinese) provided by Professor [Hung-yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/), National Taiwan University 

We have tried our best to cite these resources by giving credits to these original sources. Please contact us if you find materials where the reference is missing or that you would rather have removed.
